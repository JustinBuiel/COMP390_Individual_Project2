This program gets data about tracked meteorites 
from the nasa website and filters only "important" ones
that land in a geographical bounding box around the 
main populated continents. Each match is put into the 
correct table in a database using SQL.

To run this program from the command line you must have 
python installed and use pip to install the requests package
then all you need to do is cd to the file location and run "py main.py"
